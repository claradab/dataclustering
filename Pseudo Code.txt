Load the dataset
Define x and y values

Create 3 empty lists:
one for the distances from the centroid
one for socres
one for centroids

for i between 1 and 20:
    find 3 clusters:
        identify 3 random centroids
        for each point in the dataset, calculate the distance between that point and the centroid
        create 3 clusters of the points closest to the random centroids
        calculate a new centroid that is the mean of each cluster
        repeat this until the mean/centroid doesn't change
    repeat this i times
    
    Append the inertia (standard deviation of each point from centroid) to the empty list distance_from_centroid
    Append the centroids to the empty list centroids
    Define y_pred which is the predicted cluster for each point based on the above clustering mechanism
    Calculate the ARI score (by comparing the actual y vs the y_pred) and append the ARI score to the empty list scores
            
    index = go through the distance_from_centroid list and find the index at the smallest value 
    (This gives us the ideal i, where the standard deviation from the centroid is the smallest)
    print the ideal i
    print the centroids at the ideal i
    print the mean distance of each point from the centroid at the ideal i
    print the score at ideal i
